    <p>Have you ever sat at home, feeling like you need something to not only help with your desire for something savoury, but at the same time satisfy that sweet touth of yours?</p>
    <p>Enter crepes, the french pancakes we all love, made from the simplest ingredients while having the ability to be transformed into remarkable delicacies</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>150g Flour</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>300ml Milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted Butter(left to cool down)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar(optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cognac(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter and set it aside to cool</li>
        <li>Sift the flour through a fine-mesh sieve into a large mixing bowl to remove any lumps</li>
        <li>Add the salt and sugar(optional) to the flour, whisk to combine evenly</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, whisk gradually until it forms a thick paste</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking until the batter is smooth and lump free</li>
        <li>Add the melted butter and the cognac(optional), and whisk until fully incorporated</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After preparing the crepe batter, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
    <p>For an even better result, you can refrigerate the batter overnight for up to 12 hours.During this resting period, the flour absorbs the liquid, resulting in a smoother, more elastic batter and tender crepes.</p>

    <h4>Cooking instructions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat a pan or griddle over medium heat and slightly grease it with butter</li>
        <li>Pour in a ladleful of the batter and immediately tilt and swirl the pan to spread it into a thin, even layer</li>
        <li>Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the bottom is slightly golden and the edges begin to lift</li>
        <li>Flip the crepe and cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute on the other side, until fully cooked</li>
    </ul>
